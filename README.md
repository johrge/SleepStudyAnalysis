Sleep and Lifestyle Health Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes a sleep and lifestyle health dataset using Python. It focuses on cleaning raw data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and creating visualizations to identify patterns in sleep duration related to gender and exercise habits.

Dataset
Source: Kaggle – Sleep and Lifestyle Health Dataset
Creator: shraddha4ever20
The dataset includes information such as age, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep stages, caffeine and alcohol consumption, smoking status, and exercise frequency.

Features
Data cleaning and type conversion
Column name normalization and renaming
Grouped statistical analysis
Sleep duration distribution visualization
Comparison of sleep patterns by gender
Relationship analysis between exercise frequency and sleep duration

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib

How to Run
Install required libraries:
pip install pandas matplotlib
Update the dataset file path in the script.
Run the script:
python sleep_analysis.py
Output
The program displays summary statistics in the console and generates visualizations including:
Sleep duration histogram
Average sleep duration by gender bar chart
Sleep duration vs exercise frequency line chart

Purpose

This project demonstrates practical skills in data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and visualization for health-related datasets.
